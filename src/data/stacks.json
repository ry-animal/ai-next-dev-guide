        "info": "React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook, widely used for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. React enables developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the DOM through its virtual DOM implementation. It promotes the use of a unidirectional data flow and a component-based architecture, making it easier to manage the state and structure of large applications.",
